&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can elucidate our life as a contradiction of death. Death is 
the last part, while life is the beginning. This precious gift consists of lots of good things, good 
experiences and remarkable moments. On the other hand, it also contains bad memories, saddening
moments and miserable experiences.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the pleasure: Have you seen the flower lily?
It lives for a very short span of time. But whatever life it has got, it delivers the pleasure to the
world in that time. It passes its charms, hue, and aroma to many hearts. This is how we must live our
lives.
